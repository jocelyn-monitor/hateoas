# Hateoas

This is a Ruby gem that lets you interact with hypermedia APIs.

It's very much in development. You shouldn't use it for anything other than giggles. And maybe Unicorns.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'hateoas'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hateoas

## Usage

Read the code. More to come when I feel like _anything_ is stable.

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
